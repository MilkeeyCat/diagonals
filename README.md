# Diagonals

Note: This isnt my idea, i actually think its stupid as fuck. But i had to do it.

## Rules
Rules of the game: When it is your turn to move, you can place one token on any
square of the board. If after your turn, one or more of your opponents' pieces
are between your pieces, all these opponent's pieces become yours.

## How to make this bich work
First clone the code and all needed libraries:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/diagonals

Build it :)

    mkdir build && cd $_
    cmake ..
    make -j$(nproc)


PS. Its my first project in c++. If you see something and it makes your blood
to boil, let me know and I'll fix :justatest:
